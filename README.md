# To-do-App


To-Do app
 --------
 It might be good to research efficient to-do's examples, read on the 
 literature.
 --------
 A todo list would need to have a:
 - a datastructure to hold the different tasks. I've opted for a list
   instead of an Object. We can refractor this later on into a class.
 - each task will be created as a dictionary, held within a list. 
 - Each task will have:
    - id
    - title
    - description: a short summary
    - notes: a longer description
    - creation_date
    - due_date
    - completed - along with an automatic end date.
    - priority
